Measure distanse and velocity from obstacle when the car retracted and send them to server and open in Android App

The project was based on measuring the distance and velocity from the obstacle. His task was to read distances, and send data to the server from which the application in the Android system recived them. When the given distance was smaller than the set one switched on the buster which made sounds like when the car was moved back, the sound of which was dependent on the frequency and distance from the set obstacle.
